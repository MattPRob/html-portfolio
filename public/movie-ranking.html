<h1>The Best Movies According to Matt</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Anchorman</h3>

<p>"This burrito is delish but it is filling."</p>

<h3>Gladiator</h3>

<p>I like movies set in ancient times, and this one had a great story with amazing actors.</p>

<h3>Sword in the Stone</h3>

<p>Though I'm sad that Merlin changed Wart back into a boy, breaking the hot squirrel's heart.</p>
